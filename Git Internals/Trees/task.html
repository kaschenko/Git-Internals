<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Tree objects store the file name, and the SHA-1 hash of the file content which is the same as the blob file name for this file, or another tree object if it is a subdirectory. Tree objects can hold a group of files and directories.</p>

<p>Tree object file structure is a bit tricky to read. Just like any other Git object, a file tree object starts with a null-terminated header. The header is followed by one or more items consisting of a text line and 40-byte long binary SHA-1. The text line contains some permissions metadata and the file name.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>Add support for reading tree objects to your current program.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space <code class="java">&gt; </code>  represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
