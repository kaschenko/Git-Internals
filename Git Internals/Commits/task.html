<h5>Description</h5>

<p>A commit is a snapshot or your project. A commit object contains the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Filesystem tree</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A list of parent commits</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The author's name and email</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Date and time when the commit was originally created</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Committer's name and email (committer is the person who applied the commit)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Date and time when the commit was applied</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Commit message</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p> The commit object name, also known as "commit ID", is a SHA-1 hash of the commit object’s contents.</p>

<p>A commit may have two parents if it is a merge commit. In this case, the first parent is the preceding commit in the current branch, and the second one is the preceding commit from the branch being merged.</p>

<p>The author and committer differ if the commit was cherry-picked or changed during a merge, rebase, or another operation.</p>

<p>The commit file structure is straightforward: the git object header is followed by plain text lines in the same order as in the description above.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>Now your program should detect the object type for the specified file, and print out the object’s type and contents. The content should be reformatted as in the example. In this stage, you should support blobs and commits.</p>

<p>You will also have to translate a unix epoch timestamp to human readable date and time. You can construct a <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/time/Instant" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">java.time.Instant</a> object of the timestamp and use <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter</a> to print it out.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that commit messages usually have an empty line at the end.</p>

<h5>Examples</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space <code class="java">&gt; </code>  represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter .git directory location:
&gt; task/test
Enter git object hash:

*BLOB*
fun main() {
    while(true) {
        println("Hello Hyperskill student!")
    }
}</code></pre>
