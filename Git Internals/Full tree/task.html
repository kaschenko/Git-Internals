<h5>Description</h5>

<p>Finally, let's try to get the full filesystem tree of the project for the specified commit.</p>

<p>As you remember from stage 4, a tree object contains the file and the subdirectory list for one folder. To get the full project tree, you should recursively iterate through tree objects.</p>

<h5>Objectives</h5>

<p>Extend your program with the <code class="java">commit-tree</code> command. It should ask the user to specify the commit, and then print out the full file tree.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space <code class="java">&gt; </code>  represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
